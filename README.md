built by a group of 2nd year Usask CS Majors

## Running and Contributing Instructions
Fork this repo and add it to your [repl](https://repl.it/~) account, then run `python server.py` to launch the server. You will get a URL to give to your Battlesnake account to
test your changes. PR's to this repo will update the Competition Snake, which will be connected to Our Team on Battlesnake. 

## Dependancies 
You will need the CherryPy module installed on your repl for this to work. If you are having trouble running the server on repl, make sure you install cherrypy using pip.
